# Project board template — "AI Learning Progress"

Columns:
- Backlog
- To do (this week)
- In progress
- Review / Study group
- Done

Suggested automation notes (manual or via Projects UI):
- When an issue is labeled `in-progress` → move to "In progress"
- When an issue is closed → move to "Done"
- When an issue is labeled `needs-review` → move to "Review / Study group"

Suggested initial cards (issues):
- Python for ML — Practice and small projects
- Linear Algebra & Calculus for ML — 30-day study plan
- PyTorch basics — implement training loop
- Transformers — implement attention from scratch
- MLOps basics — deploy a model as an API
- Agile scoping for quick wins with AI
- Rapid prototyping for ML engineers with lightweight environments
- Navigating public AI models (Hugging Face, model cards, licensing, ethics)
- Measuring ML impact: Success & Business Metrics
- Apply AI skills in full-day workshops

How to create the board:
- Via web UI: Projects → New Project → name and create columns above, then add existing issues or create new ones from the board.
- Via GitHub CLI (projects beta): use `gh project` commands (see gh docs).
