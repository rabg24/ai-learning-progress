## Agile scoping for quick wins with AI
Description:
Define a process to scope AI projects for maximum early impact and fast learning. Focus on identifying business problems that are tractable with available data/resources and can yield measurable value using existing AI/ML techniques.

Checklist:
- [ ] Identify 3-5 candidate business problems suitable for quick AI wins.
- [ ] Evaluate available data and AI maturity.
- [ ] Draft one-pager for each, scoping for timelines and delivery.
- [ ] Get feedback from stakeholders.
- [ ] Select 1-2 for rapid prototyping.

Labels: skill, ai, project, priority:high

## Rapid prototyping for ML engineers with lightweight environments
Description:
Create a workflow for fast AI/ML experiments using cloud notebooks (e.g., Google Colab) and pre-trained models. Document best practices for setup, sharing, and reproducibility.

Checklist:
- [ ] Set up a Google Colab project.
- [ ] Run inference with a pre-trained model.
- [ ] Share results via Colab links.
- [ ] Experiment with parameter changes and document outcomes.
- [ ] Record learnings in a standardized format.

Labels: skill, ml, project, resource

## Navigating public AI models (Hugging Face, model cards, licensing, ethics)
Description:
Learn to evaluate and select public AI models (especially on Hugging Face), focusing on reading model cards and understanding licensing, bias disclosures, and responsible AI practices.

Checklist:
- [ ] Pick 2-3 trending models from Hugging Face.
- [ ] Review their model cards for intended use, limitations, and metrics.
- [ ] Analyze any bias or fairness statements.
- [ ] Check and document licensing terms.
- [ ] Summarize how to make responsible model choices for projects.

Labels: skill, ai, ethics, resource

## Measuring ML impact: Success & Business Metrics
Description:
Develop methods to measure the business and technical impact of ML projects. Define key success and business metrics, and set up simple evaluation templates.

Checklist:
- [ ] List relevant business and ML metrics per use-case.
- [ ] Set up basic tracking (spreadsheet or notebook).
- [ ] Review impact at regular intervals.
- [ ] Share findings in a project review meeting.
- [ ] Document lessons learned and ideas for improvement.

Labels: skill, ai, metrics, project

## Apply AI skills in full-day workshops
Description:
Plan and participate in a full-day workshop to integrate learned AI skills. Cover all prior modules (scoping, prototyping, responsible model selection, impact measurement) in a practical setting.

Checklist:
- [ ] Outline workshop agenda covering key skills.
- [ ] Prepare workshop materials and resources.
- [ ] Run mini-projects combining multiple skills.
- [ ] Gather and give feedback.
- [ ] Write up workshop summary and next steps.

- [ ] Implement scaled dot-product attention and multi-head attention.
- [ ] Run toy examples and visualize attention weights.

Labels: skill, difficulty:hard

---

## MLOps basics — deploy a model as an API
Description:
Learn deployment practices: packaging a model, serving as an API, basic monitoring.

Checklist:
- [ ] Containerize a small model service (Docker).
- [ ] Expose a simple REST endpoint (Flask/FastAPI).
- [ ] Add simple logging/monitoring and a README for deployment steps.

Labels: skill, project, difficulty:medium

How I can help next
- I can format these into a GitHub issue-import CSV for bulk upload, or
- I can wait until you create the repo and then create these issues for you (I’ll need repo access or you can run the provided patch/CSV), or
- I can produce a single patch/commit you can apply locally to create these as issues via the GitHub web UI (or I can create them automatically when you tell me the repo exists and you want me to push).

Which format do you want me to produce for adding these to the repository: issue-import CSV, ready-to-paste issue bodies, or a bulk API push once you confirm the repo is created?
