# AI Learning Progress

This repository is a personal tracker for learning AI skills. It contains starter issues, templates, example notebooks and scripts to help with rapid prototyping, model evaluation, and workshop planning.

How to use
1. Create an issue for each new learning item using the "Skill progress" issue template in .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/.
2. Move issues across a Project board (Backlog / To do / In progress / Review / Done).
3. Use milestones for timeboxed learning goals (e.g., 30-day ML fundamentals).
4. Tag issues with labels (skill, difficulty, resource, in-progress, blocked, done).

Repository structure
- .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/skill-progress.md — issue template for tracking progress
- .github/labels.yml — suggested labels for quick setup
- docs/ — metrics templates and workshop materials
- examples/ — starter scripts and Colab-friendly examples
